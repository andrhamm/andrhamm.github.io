    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend marked a big milestone for our homestead. I made enough progress on the coop build on Saturday that I was able to move the chickens from their 4&#8217; x 4&#8217; brooder (inside a spare room of our house) to the cabin part of the coop before the sun set. I was able to keep an eye on them all of Sunday and make a few adjustments as needed. Check out the album.</p>

<p>I added a couple simple supports to mount the roost to. There are two roosts (and the smaller one from their old brooder) made from a branch of the tree I had to cut down while building the roof of the coop. I think it is better to use a natural roost instead of the other option of making them out of 2&#8217; x 4&#8217; lumber.</p>

<p>I also set up a new hanging feeder since they outgrew their chick feeder weeks ago. This one hangs from the ceiling to just a few inches off the floor of the cabin and helps prevent the feeder from being filled up with bedding and waste.</p>

<p>I finished enclosing the entire run with hardware cloth (better than chicken wire), but I didn&rsquo;t tackle making the main door so I just temporarily stapled hardware cloth right over the opening. Unfortunately this means I can&rsquo;t get in to the run until I&rsquo;m ready to install the door.</p>

<p>There is definitely still a lot to do. Primarily the front door, but also the nest box needs to be finished and the area around the coop will need some landscaping. I&rsquo;m contemplating which kinds of shrubs and mulch to use. The area gets mostly shade during the day. I also plan to build a removable sandbox for the girls to take their dust baths in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent another 25 hours or so on my chicken coop this weekend. I&rsquo;ll roll all this into a more detailed post at some point, but for now check out this album.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This weekend was mostly spent on the cabin part of the coop (as opposed to the larger, open &ldquo;run&rdquo;). This is where the chickens will roost at night. I decided to line the floor of the coop with linoleum flooring, to protect the wood from absorbing any of the nasty smells/fluids from the chicken waste. It should also make it much easier to clean out periodically.</p>

<p>The front of the coop has a window to let in some natural sunlight and allow for needed ventilation in the summer. I covered the window with hardware cloth (strong chicken wire) from the inside, but will add a sheet of clear plexy-glass before the fall/winter season for weather proofing.</p>

<p>The entire back side of the coop is a swinging door with a really beefy hinge (spring-loaded to prevent the door from remaining open) and latch. This door is essential for cleaning out the cabin and is the only way a person can get into the coop.</p>

<p>The siding is all tongue &amp; groove boards which makes for a very time-consuming build. I&rsquo;m not complaining though, my father-in-law Chuck had it left over from his house build and gave it to me for free! Similar boards at Lowe&rsquo;s run about $10 each. Each! I would have just left it at plywood if that was my only option, but I had so many of these boards left over that I figured this would be well worth the extra effort. I love how the siding looks, with its nice horizontal grooves, it really adds to the desired &ldquo;barn&rdquo; look. Of course the &ldquo;barn door red&rdquo; paint with white trim really paid off too!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found the lack of documentation for JBuilder partials to be very frustrating. Ideally I could write one partial for each of my ActiveRecord models and re-use them in all my JBuilder views. The problem comes when you have a model like User, for example, which has one or more Photos. When I request the <code>show</code> action for my User controller, I want the User partial to be rendered with it&rsquo;s Photo as a child (using the Photo partial). On the other hand, when I request the <code>show</code> action for my Photo, I want the Photo partial to be rendered with it&rsquo;s User as a child (using the User partial). This can lead to an infinite loop which, at first glance, can only be solved by making many individual partials for the same model, like <code>photo_without_user</code> and <code>photo_with_user</code>.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Going a little deeper, you&rsquo;ll find that the <code>partial!</code> method will pass any data you give it along to the view (the unrecognized hash keys will be available to the view as local variables of the same name). In the following example, I simply pass a custom variable, <code>exclude</code>, into the call to <code>partial!</code> and use it as a condition in the photo partial view. Obviously this will grow cumbersome if you are nesting partials more than a couple layers deep, but for my use, it works quite well.</p>

<pre><code># In `users/_user.json.jbuilder`:
json.(user, :id, :name)
json.photo do
  json.partial! 'photos/photo', photo: user.photo, exclude: [:user]
end
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<pre><code># In `photos/_photo.json.jbuilder`:
json.(photo, :url, :caption)
unless exclude.include?(:user)
  json.user do
    json.partial! 'users/user', user: photo.user
  end
end
</code></pre>
