<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few days, a bunch of new toys have steadily been arriving at my doorstep. But first, did I mention that <a href="/blog/2014/07/24/downsizing-sucks">my last post about the brewery</a> can go suck it? <!-- more -->Yeah, I wrote that post late at night while I was feeling a little overwhelmed and like my brewery would never happen. But I woke up the next morning with a renewed sense of purpose and just a generally uplifted can-do attitude. With the support of my amazing wife, I&rsquo;m going to make this brewery happen. The size of my pots, in the grand scheme of things, doesn&rsquo;t really change how the brewery would be built anyway. Sure, I&rsquo;ll still have to worry about where to put all my beer, but I&rsquo;ll deal with that when the time comes. Every other piece of the brewery would need to be built the same if the pots were 10G anyway, so I&rsquo;m sticking with the 20G setup.</p>

<h3>Brewery Update</h3>

<p>So the brewery build is back on track. Since the last post, I ripped up the bamboo laminate flooring and molding in the basement brew room, and rented and used a concrete floor sander from Home Depot to remove the existing paint on the floor. This weekend is Labor Day weekend and I have a lot of work to do. I need to finish cleaning up around the edges where the concrete sanding left behind a bunch of muck. After that I&rsquo;ll be putting down a coat of garage floor epoxy that I got custom mixed at Lowe&rsquo;s to match the color scheme I want for the brewery.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going for a super sleek/modern industrial look not unlike the <a href="http://www.theelectricbrewery.com/gallery">awesome basement brewery</a> designed by Kal, the creator of The Electric Brewery (the instructions I used to build my control panel). I&rsquo;m also pulling on a lot of inspiration from <a href="http://www.theelectricbrewery.com/testimonials">all the other</a> Electric Brewery setups out there. Even the names of the Valspar paint color swatches are pretty badass: &ldquo;High Speed Steel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Polished Silver&rdquo;. These colors are going to really make all the stainless steel equipment &ldquo;pop&rdquo;. Those toys I mentioned earlier included diamond plating outlet and switch covers, as well as some really nice looking brushed aluminum sheeting that is going to make a kickass backsplash on the wall behind the kettles. More on all that next week so stay tuned.</p>

<h3>Portable Brewery</h3>

<p>The basement brewery project is a huge undertaking and I really won&rsquo;t be able to use it until everything is done and in place. At this point, that&rsquo;s looking like it could still be a few months out. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve been actively researching many other areas of homebrewing. I&rsquo;m playing around with a lot of stuff around automation with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I also recently learned about PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) which is really interesting to me and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be seeing a post about all that soon. Anyway, back on track.</p>

<p>One of my goals that is running parrallel to my goal of the basement brewery is the idea of also having a very portable electric brewery that I could potentially take with me and brew at a friends house or at a local brew day. Obviously the 3 kettle 20G HERMS system isn&rsquo;t going to be leaving my basement without something short of a U-Haul. The goals of the portable brewery are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uses 120v electricity to brew a 5G batch (5G in the keg)</li>
<li>Completely modular- can be used in more than one way</li>
<li>Supports 2 pumps with standard outlets (separate on/off switches)</li>
<li>Uses a single temp probe and PID for auto-tuning precise tempurature setpoints</li>
<li>Small footprint, portable</li>
<li>Keep it simple, stupid!</li>
</ol>


<p>So there are several pieces to this setup; the control panel (the brain!) and the separate modules. Right now the pico panel is in a non-working state&hellip; I have some debugging to do to diagnose what is going on with the solid-state relay which appears to not be working. For point #2, an example of another way to use this would be a sous-vide in the kitchen (this adds to the importance of a small footprint for the panel), which would involve a smaller heating element plugged into the panel, and a very tiny recirculation pump. Modular brewing options would be the RIMS tube or a brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) pot. Another whacky use would even be to apply this to the cold side of brewing. The PID is just as capable of turning a fermentation chamber on and off according to the low set point as it is for turning a heating element on for mashing/boiling! How cool is that?! Another modular piece of the equation is that the support for &ldquo;pumps&rdquo; is really just a couple of auxiliary outlets with switches, so you could plug a fan in there if that applies to the task at hand, or whatever you need. I&rsquo;m currently thinking through how to make one of the auxiliary outlets have 3 modes: on, off, and auto. The &ldquo;auto&rdquo; setting would fire along with the heating element, but still let you switch it off if needed. We&rsquo;ll see though, because it has to align with goal #6!</p>

<p>Here is the Pico Panel build and it being used as a sous-vide controller:</p>

<h3>DIY RIMS Tube</h3>

<p>RIMS is a type of electric brewing system whereby the wort is heated directly during the mash as it is pumped over a heating element. This eliminates the need for a dedicated hot liquor tank, making it more portable and cheaper than a HERMS. In HERMS, you typically have 3 vessels, a mash tun with no heat applied directly, a hot liquor tank with heating element and a coil which the wort is pumped (circulated) through without contacting the hot water directly (the water is kept at mash temp by the element), and a boil kettle with heating element.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f51/rims-dummies-114997">an old thread on the HomeBrewTalk forums</a> for a cool design made out of regular stainless steel pipe fittings and opted to go that route rather than buying a pre-made shiny RIMS tube. I like the idea of being able to customize it however I want by unscrewing a fitting or two and maybe adding something in-line or making a change. The fittings are all 1.5&#8221; NPT 304 stainless. This thing is super beefy and I&rsquo;m a little worried that will make it difficult to heat on 120v, but we&rsquo;ll see. I sprung for a tri-clover to 1.5&#8221; NPT fitting so I could use a tri-clover heating element enclosure for easy cleaning. I really need to be able to easily dry the element after a brew because they are known to rust if left damp. The heating element I already had from the souse-vide doesn&rsquo;t want to fit nicely inside the RIMS tube, so I&rsquo;ll need to order another one, which is tricky because the product listings on Amazon for these things are notorious for being inaccurate. I really need an Ultra-Low Watt Density element to prevent scorching and to reduce the likelihood of an accidental dry-fire explosions (turning on the element without liquid on it to dissipate the heat) which are guaranteed on the high watt density elements.</p>

<p>Well this blog post took way too long to finish (I started on 8-29 and minimized it until today, 9-5) so I&rsquo;m going to end it here, but stay tuned for more updates.</p>
