    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend marked a big milestone for our homestead. I made enough progress on the coop build on Saturday that I was able to move the chickens from their 4' x 4' brooder (inside a spare room of our house) to the cabin part of the coop before the sun set. I was able to keep an eye on them all of Sunday and make a few adjustments as needed. Check out the album.</p>

<p>I added a couple simple supports to mount the roost to. There are two roosts (and the smaller one from their old brooder) made from a branch of the tree I had to cut down while building the roof of the coop. I think it is better to use a natural roost instead of the other option of making them out of 2' x 4' lumber.</p>

<p>I also set up a new hanging feeder since they outgrew their chick feeder weeks ago. This one hangs from the ceiling to just a few inches off the floor of the cabin and helps prevent the feeder from being filled up with bedding and waste.</p>

<p>I finished enclosing the entire run with hardware cloth (better than chicken wire), but I didn&rsquo;t tackle making the main door so I just temporarily stapled hardware cloth right over the opening. Unfortunately this means I can&rsquo;t get in to the run until I&rsquo;m ready to install the door.</p>

<p>There is definitely still a lot to do. Primarily the front door, but also the nest box needs to be finished and the area around the coop will need some landscaping. I&rsquo;m contemplating which kinds of shrubs and mulch to use. The area gets mostly shade during the day. I also plan to build a removable sandbox for the girls to take their dust baths in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent another 25 hours or so on my chicken coop this weekend. I&rsquo;ll roll all this into a more detailed post at some point, but for now check out this album.</p>

<p>This weekend was mostly spent on the cabin part of the coop (as opposed to the larger, open &ldquo;run&rdquo;). This is where the chickens will roost at night. I decided to line the floor of the coop with linoleum flooring, to protect the wood from absorbing any of the nasty smells/fluids from the chicken waste. It should also make it much easier to clean out periodically.</p>

<p>The front of the coop has a window to let in some natural sunlight and allow for needed ventilation in the summer. I covered the window with hardware cloth (strong chicken wire) from the inside, but will add a sheet of clear plexy-glass before the fall/winter season for weather proofing.</p>

<p>The entire back side of the coop is a swinging door with a really beefy hinge (spring-loaded to prevent the door from remaining open) and latch. This door is essential for cleaning out the cabin and is the only way a person can get into the coop.</p>

<p>The siding is all tongue &amp; groove boards which makes for a very time-consuming build. I&rsquo;m not complaining though, my father-in-law Chuck had it left over from his house build and gave it to me for free! Similar boards at Lowe&rsquo;s run about $10 each. Each! I would have just left it at plywood if that was my only option, but I had so many of these boards left over that I figured this would be well worth the extra effort. I love how the siding looks, with its nice horizontal grooves, it really adds to the desired &ldquo;barn&rdquo; look. Of course the &ldquo;barn door red&rdquo; paint with white trim really paid off too!</p>
