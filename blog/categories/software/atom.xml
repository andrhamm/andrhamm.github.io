    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I went to install ElasticSearch with Homebrew on Mac OS X, I got the following error message when trying to start up ElasticSearch: <code>"Unsupported major.minor version 51.0"</code>. I found the experience kind of sucky, with a lot of misleading or generally unhelpful posts out there when Googling. So naturally I figured I&rsquo;d add to the confusion. Here is how I solved the problem on my machine. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Find out which version of Java you are using:</p>

<pre><code>java -version
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably 1.6 if you are on Mac OS X. That was my case, and I needed 1.7 for ElasticSearch.</p>

<p>See where your Java lives:</p>

<pre><code>which java
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably <code>/usr/bin/java</code> if you haven&rsquo;t monkied with your native install.</p>

<p>Download <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">JDK 1.7</a></p>

<pre><code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
</code></pre>

<p>I restarted at this point but my symlink (<code>which java</code>) didn&rsquo;t update. It seems like kind of a shitty way to get what you want, but setting your <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable will now point your scripts to the right version:</p>

<pre><code>export JAVA_HOME="`/usr/libexec/java_home -v '1.7*'`"
</code></pre>

<p>This sort of stuff seems to come up anytime you mention JDK or JVM being a dependency of anything. Sweet dice&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found the lack of documentation for JBuilder partials to be very frustrating. Ideally I could write one partial for each of my ActiveRecord models and re-use them in all my JBuilder views. The problem comes when you have a model like User, for example, which has one or more Photos. When I request the <code>show</code> action for my User controller, I want the User partial to be rendered with it&rsquo;s Photo as a child (using the Photo partial). On the other hand, when I request the <code>show</code> action for my Photo, I want the Photo partial to be rendered with it&rsquo;s User as a child (using the User partial). This can lead to an infinite loop which, at first glance, can only be solved by making many individual partials for the same model, like <code>photo_without_user</code> and <code>photo_with_user</code>.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Going a little deeper, you&rsquo;ll find that the <code>partial!</code> method will pass any data you give it along to the view (the unrecognized hash keys will be available to the view as local variables of the same name). In the following example, I simply pass a custom variable, <code>exclude</code>, into the call to <code>partial!</code> and use it as a condition in the photo partial view. Obviously this will grow cumbersome if you are nesting partials more than a couple layers deep, but for my use, it works quite well.</p>

<pre><code># In `users/_user.json.jbuilder`:
json.(user, :id, :name)
json.photo do
  json.partial! 'photos/photo', photo: user.photo, exclude: [:user]
end
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<pre><code># In `photos/_photo.json.jbuilder`:
json.(photo, :url, :caption)
unless exclude.include?(:user)
  json.user do
    json.partial! 'users/user', user: photo.user
  end
end
</code></pre>
